# Tetris .Net desktop app

The idea is to port/translate this .NET console app into a cross-platform app.

- I have a .NET MAUI user interface.
- I have a .NET console app for the gameplay. 

## Figma Design for the interface

   Install Sayers.SDL2 on Nuget Package Manager.

## Special thanks to Javier Lopez for the c++ source code and tutorial.

This is a c# translation of the original c++ project.
